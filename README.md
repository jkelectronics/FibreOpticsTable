# FibreOpticsTable
Table with sensors &amp; fibre optics: 

This project is made for my personal use, i've adapted my coffeetable with some sensors & fibre optics..
It detect motions above or on the table wich will light up fibre optics in the area of motion.

For the project i've used:
-Esp32
-38x IR emitting diode (940nm)
-38x IR receiver diode
-38 330 ohm resistor
-38 1M ohm resistor
-2x CD74HC4067 multiplexer
-1x ws2812board
-external 5V Battery

The code is about 500+ rules, but could be coded in less..
I'm new to coding and this was for me the only way to make it work properly..

Feel free to use or adapt the code just make sure to give it a star ;D

Photo's & wiring diagrams will be uploaded shortly..
